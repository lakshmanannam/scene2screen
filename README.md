# scene2screen
Sceen2Screen uses a Flask backend to bridge cinematic UI with local Ollama AI (Granite4 Micro). It manages prompt chaining for scripts, characters, and sound. Flask sessions ensure secure data persistence, automating pre-production while keeping creative vision central in a private, local environment.
